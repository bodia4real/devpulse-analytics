## Database Connections

**Q: Difference between @supabase/supabase-js and postgres.js?**
- **Supabase client**: HTTP API, uses API keys, good for frontend/client-side, has auth/storage/real-time
- **postgres.js**: Direct PostgreSQL, uses DB credentials, good for backend, faster, full SQL support
- **Use both**: `postgres.js` for backend queries, `@supabase/supabase-js` for auth/storage/real-time
